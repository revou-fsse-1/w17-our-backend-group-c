# SIMERCE APP 🛒

![](/assets/simerce-app.png)

Simerce is an acronym from Simple E-commerce App. This app was inspired from one of Mr.Dandi's friends that has a smalll groceries shop. He is wondering if his products he is selling can be put into an app like e-commerce but with much smaller scope.

### Database Diagram

![Diagram Database](assets/diagram.png)

In our database diagram, we have established a one-to-many relationship between the User and Wishlist models, indicating that a user can have multiple wishlists. Additionally, we have implemented a many-to-many relationship between the Wishlist and Product models, allowing for the storage of multiple products within a wishlist and the ability to associate products with multiple wishlists. This design provides users with the flexibility to create and manage multiple wishlists while enabling products to be saved in and associated with various wishlists seamlessly.

---

In order to run this project locally, you need to clone this repository first using git clone

```bash
$ https://github.com/revou-fsse-1/w17-our-backend-group-c.git
```

then run `pnpm install` in your terminal to download all dependencies

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

create `docker-compose.yaml` on root folder (where the package.json installed) and fill with these commands to install postgresql database locally on your computer

```
version: "3"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    ports:
    - 5432:5432
    environment:
    - POSTGRES_DB=revou
    - POSTGRES_USER=revou
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
    - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=dandi@gmail.com
      - PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password
    ports:
      - 15432:80
```

don't forget to create `.env` files on root folder same like before with these command:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://revou:password@database:5432/revou?schema=public"
```

and run docker with these command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

after that you can start the server using these following command :

```
